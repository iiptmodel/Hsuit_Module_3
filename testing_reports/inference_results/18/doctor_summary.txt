The TSH level is 4.52 mIU/mL, which is above the reference range of 0.30-4.5 mIU/mL. This suggests a possible mild thyroid dysfunction, potentially hypothyroidism. The patient is a 24-year-old female. Further evaluation, including free T4 and possibly free T3, is warranted to determine the etiology of the elevated TSH and rule out other potential causes. The patient's age and gender should also be considered when interpreting the results.
