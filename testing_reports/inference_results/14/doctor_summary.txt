The TSH level is 0.60 mIU/mL, which falls within the reference range of 0.30-4.5 mIU/mL. The HbA1c is 10.90%, indicating a diabetic state. The Mean Blood Glucose (MBG) is 266.13 mg/dL, also consistent with a diabetic state. The patient's TSH is within normal limits, suggesting no acute thyroid dysfunction. The elevated HbA1c and MBG values warrant further investigation and management of the patient's diabetes.
