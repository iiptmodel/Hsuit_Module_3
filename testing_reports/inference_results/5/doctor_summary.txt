The thyroid function test results indicate normal thyroid hormone levels. T3 (triiodothyronine) is within the normal range at 1.96 ng/mL, T4 (thyroxine) is within the normal range at 10.55 mcg/dL, and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is within the normal range at 0.11 mlU/mL. These results suggest that the thyroid gland is functioning within the expected physiological parameters. The normal TSH level indicates that the pituitary gland is appropriately stimulating the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones.
