The thyroid function test results indicate normal thyroid hormone levels. T3 is within the normal range, T4 is also within the normal range, and TSH is suppressed, suggesting hyperthyroidism. The suppressed TSH level is a key finding, potentially indicating an overactive thyroid gland. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause of the suppressed TSH, which could be due to autonomous thyroid tissue or other factors affecting pituitary function.
