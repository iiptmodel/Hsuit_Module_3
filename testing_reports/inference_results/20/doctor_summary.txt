The urine culture reveals the presence of *Escherichia coli* with a colony count of 100,000 CFU/ml, demonstrating a significant bacterial load. The organism exhibits susceptibility to a broad range of antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cefpime, cefixime, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, tazobactam-piperacillin, cefoperazone-sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/relebactam, cefiderocol, ceftolozane/tazobactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and tetracycline. The report indicates sterile pyuria, which is negative urine culture in the presence of clinical and microscopic findings suggestive of infection, potentially due to the patient being on antibiotics or infection by fastidious organisms.
