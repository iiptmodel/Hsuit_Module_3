**Analysis of Urine Culture Report**

The urine culture report indicates the presence of *Escherichia coli* with a colony count of 100,000 CFU/mL. The organism is susceptible to a broad range of antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/relebactam, cefiderocol, ceftolozane/tazobactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and tetracycline. The report also notes sterile pyuria, which is negative urine culture in the presence of clinical and microscopic findings suggestive of infection. This finding suggests that the patient is already on antibiotics or that the infection is caused by fastidious organisms or interstitial nephritis/cystitis.
