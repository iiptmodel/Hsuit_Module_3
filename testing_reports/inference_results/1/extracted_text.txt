Method:Chemi-Luminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA)

NOTE :  Primary malfunction of thyroid gland may result in excessive (hyper) or below normal (hypo) release of T3 or T4. In addition, as TSH directly affects thyroid function, malfunction of pituitary or the hypothalamus influences the thyroid gland activity. Disease of any portion the thyroid-pituitary-hypothalamus system may influence the levels of T3 and T4 in the blood.

Clinical significance: Vitamin B12 or Cyanocobalamin, is a complex corrinoid compound found exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat eggs and milk. It is critical in normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation and in the formation of myelin sheath. Vitamin-B12 is used to find out neurological abnormalities and impaired DNA synthesis associated with macrocytic anemias.

## IRON STUDIES (Iron &amp; TIBC)

Test

Result

Unit ug/dL ug/dL

Biological Ref. Range

IRON :

69

28-170 ug/dL

Total Iron binding Capacity (TIBC) :

331

250-400 ug/dl ug/dL

Transferin Saturation :

20.85

%

20 - 50 %

Method:

Ferene

Note:Serum iron measures the level of iron in the liquid portion of the blood. Low iron levels maybe seen in anemia (microcytic and hypochromic). High levels of serum iron in hereditary hemochromatosis, multiple blood transfusions, and a few other conditions.  TIBC (Total iron-binding capacity) measures all the proteins in blood available to bind with iron, including transferrin. TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin.
