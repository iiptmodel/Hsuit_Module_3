The patient is a 65-year-old female presenting with thyroid function tests. T3 is low (0.52 ng/mL), T4 is within the normal range (4.19 mcg/dL), and TSH is markedly elevated (96.20 mlU/mL). This suggests hypothyroidism, likely secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction, given the elevated TSH. Vitamin B12 levels are within the normal range (431.0 pg/mL). Iron studies show a low serum iron (69 ug/dL) and elevated TIBC (331 ug/dL), indicating iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is also low (20.85%), further supporting iron deficiency.
