The patient is a 57-year-old female with a Vitamin B12 level of 459 pg/mL. This result is significantly elevated, falling outside the normal reference range of 110-800 pg/mL. The elevated B12 level could be due to various factors, including dietary intake, malabsorption, or, less commonly, a functional abnormality in B12 metabolism. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause of the hypervitaminosis B12.
