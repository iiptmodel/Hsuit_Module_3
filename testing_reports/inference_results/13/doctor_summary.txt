The patient is a 52-year-old female with a Vitamin B12 level of 390 pg/mL, which is significantly elevated above the reference range of 110-800 pg/mL. The Vitamin D Total (25-OH) level is 21.96 ng/mL, indicating sufficient Vitamin D levels, falling within the 31-100 ng/mL range. The elevated B12 level warrants further investigation to rule out potential causes such as pernicious anemia or other conditions affecting B12 metabolism. The adequate Vitamin D level is a positive finding.
