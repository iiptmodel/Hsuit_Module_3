**Analysis of Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D Levels**

The patient is a 52-year-old female presenting with a Vitamin B12 level of 390 pg/mL, which is significantly elevated (above the reference range of 110-800 pg/mL). This elevated level suggests possible Vitamin B12 excess or a laboratory error. The Vitamin D total (25-OH) level is 21.96 ng/mL, indicating sufficient Vitamin D levels (31-100 ng/mL). The patient's Vitamin D level is within the normal range, and there is no indication of deficiency or toxicity.

**Key findings and observations:**

*   **Vitamin B12:** Significantly elevated (390 pg/mL)
*   **Vitamin D:** Sufficient (21.96 ng/mL)

**Notable measurements or test results:**

*   Vitamin B12: 390 pg/mL
*   Vitamin D: 21.96 ng/mL

**Clinical significance:**

The elevated Vitamin B12 level warrants further investigation to rule out a laboratory error or a true Vitamin B12 excess. While the Vitamin D level is within the normal range, it is important to consider the patient's sun exposure and dietary intake.

**Any areas requiring attention:**

The significantly elevated Vitamin B12 level needs to be re-evaluated to confirm its accuracy. Further investigation may be needed to determine the cause of the elevated level.
