Clinical significance: Vitamin B12 or Cyanocobalamin, is a complex corrinoid compound found exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat eggs and milk. It is critical in normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation and in the formation of myelin sheath. Vitamin-B12 is used to find out neurological abnormalities and impaired DNA synthesis associated with macrocytic anemias.

Deficiency : &lt; 20 Insufficiency: 21-30

Sufficient : 31-100

Method:Chemi-Luminescence Immunoassay (CLIA)

Note:Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and exists in two main forms as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) which is synthesized in skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol in response to sunlight exposure &amp; Ergocalciferol(vitamin D2) present mainly in dietary sources. Both Cholecalciferol &amp; Ergocalciferol are converted to 25(OH). A low blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may mean that a person is not getting enough exposure to sunlight or enough dietary vitamin D to meet his or her body's demand or that there is a problem with its absorption from the intestines.
