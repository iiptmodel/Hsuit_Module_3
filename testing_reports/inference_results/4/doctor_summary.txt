The IgE total test result is 201.9 IU/mL, which falls within the reference range of 0.0-378 IU/mL. This indicates a normal level of IgE in the blood. Elevated IgE levels can suggest allergic reactions or parasitic infections. Further investigation may be warranted if the patient reports symptoms suggestive of allergies or parasitic infestations.
