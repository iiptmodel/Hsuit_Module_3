The S. Total IgE level is 201.9 IU/mL, which falls within the reference range of 0.0-378 IU/mL. Elevated IgE levels can indicate allergic reactions, parasitic infections, or certain inflammatory conditions. While the result is within the normal range, it's important to consider the patient's clinical presentation and any relevant medical history to determine if further investigation is warranted. A normal IgE level does not always rule out the possibility of underlying immune dysregulation or allergic predisposition.
