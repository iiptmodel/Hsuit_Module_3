The thyroid function test results indicate that the patient's T3, T4, and TSH levels are within the normal reference ranges. The T3 level is 1.14 ng/mL, T4 is 6.93 mcg/dL, and TSH is 1.47 mlU/mL. These values suggest that the thyroid gland is functioning within the expected physiological parameters. The TSH level is slightly above the lower limit of normal, but still within the reference range.
