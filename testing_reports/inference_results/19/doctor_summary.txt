The thyroid function test (TFT) results indicate that the patient's T3, T4, and TSH levels are within the normal reference ranges. The T3 level is 1.14 ng/mL, T4 is 6.93 mcg/dL, and TSH is 1.47 mlU/mL. These values suggest normal thyroid hormone production and pituitary function. However, it's important to consider the patient's clinical presentation and any other relevant medical history, as the interpretation of these results should be individualized.
