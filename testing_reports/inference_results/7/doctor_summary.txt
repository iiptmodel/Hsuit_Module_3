The patient is a 59-year-old male with a Vitamin B12 level of 448 pg/mL. This result falls within the normal reference range of 200-911 pg/mL. Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis, erythrocyte maturation, and myelin sheath formation. Elevated levels of Vitamin B12 can be associated with macrocytic anemia and neurological abnormalities. While the current result is within the normal range, it is important to consider the patient's clinical history and any symptoms suggestive of B12 deficiency or excess.
