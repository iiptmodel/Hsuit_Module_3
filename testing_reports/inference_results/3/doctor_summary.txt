**Analysis of Anti-CCP Antibody Test Results**

The Anti-CCP antibody test result is significantly elevated at 6.46 U/mL, exceeding the normal range of <17.0 U/mL. This indicates a high likelihood of anti-CCP antibodies being present in the patient's serum. The presence of these autoantibodies is highly specific for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and their detection can aid in early diagnosis, even before the onset of irreversible joint damage. This test is particularly useful in patients with undifferentiated arthritis, where the clinical presentation is suggestive of RA but does not fully meet the diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the elevated Anti-CCP antibody levels warrant further investigation and consideration of RA diagnosis and management.
