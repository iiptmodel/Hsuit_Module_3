The report indicates the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, with a result of 6.46 U/mL. This result is above the normal range of <17.0 U/mL, suggesting a positive anti-CCP antibody test. Given the high specificity of anti-CCP antibodies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this finding warrants further investigation to assess the likelihood of RA development. The clinical significance of this result is that it may indicate early RA, potentially before the onset of irreversible joint damage. Therefore, close monitoring and repeat testing are recommended, especially in patients with undifferentiated arthritis.
