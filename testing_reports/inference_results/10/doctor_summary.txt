The TSH result is 8.36 mIU/mL, which is above the reference range of 0.30-4.5 mIU/mL. This indicates possible hypothyroidism. The patient is a 35-year-old female. Further evaluation, including free T4 and possibly free T3 levels, is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology of the elevated TSH. The patient's age and sex should also be considered when interpreting the results.
