The TSH result is 8.36 mIU/mL, which is significantly elevated above the reference range of 0.30-4.5 mIU/mL. This indicates hypothyroidism. The patient is a 35-year-old female. The elevated TSH suggests the pituitary gland is attempting to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone, but the thyroid gland is not responding adequately. This could be due to various causes, including thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, or thyroid hormone resistance. Further evaluation, including free T4 and free T3 levels, is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology.
